I worked on my gallery.html for assignment 12

Sizing
I ended up deleting one image so that there was an even amount of images with three in each row.
.

Margin
There is a margin around all of the pictures.

Hover
When you hover over the images, they take one a half seconds to get to their maximum size. Also, when you hover over the "about" "gallery" and "home" it changes to words to a different color.
