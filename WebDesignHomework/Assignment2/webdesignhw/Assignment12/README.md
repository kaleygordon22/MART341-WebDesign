I worked on my gallery.html for assignment 12

Sizing
I chose specific sizing for the images on the page so that the layout lines up correctly.

Border
Between, above, and below each picture there is a border so that the pictures are spaced out.

Margin
There is also a margin around all of the pictures.

Padding
I included padding in the navigation portion.

Dropdown
I didn't include a dropdown, but there is a hover effect over the naviagtio options.

Position
Each aspect of the page is positioned so that the website isn't over-crowded.
