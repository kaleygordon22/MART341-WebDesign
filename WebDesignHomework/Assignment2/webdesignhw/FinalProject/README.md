Final Project
For my final project I have continued to work on my Coffee Explorations website. This is the website I have put the most work into, and it is also the project I am most proud of. I feel that the website itself is not only a perfect representation of the vibes that coffee gives off, but the colors and images also represnt my personality very well. I added a couple lines onto my home page to add some extra detail and separate the sections better.
