Final Project
For my final project I have continued to work on my Coffee Explorations website. I chose this to be my final project because it is my favorite website I have made and I am proud of it. I spent so much time learning how to do this and trying my best to make it perfect. My website includes 4 pages with a well-organized layout as well as an external stylesheet. I've incorporated a different font and italicized certain parts of the text. Each page except for one contains images showing beautiful places and beautiful drinks. I chose to keep one page without any images because there was something pleasing to me about having only words on one of the pages. Thank you for this class and everything I have learned.
