                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Freshly Brewed Coffee:</strong> 1/2 cup of freshly brewed coffee, brew it however strong you like it</li>
                        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Heat up your choice of milk in a small pot until it is hot, but do not boil it</li>
                        <li><strong>Pumpkin Puree:</strong> Take one can of pumpkin puree and use however much you would like. It is a personal preference on how pumpkin-flavored you would like</li>
                        <li><strong>Maple Syrup/Vanilla:</strong> Used for sweetener, use both, one, or neither, 1 or 2 tablespoons depends on how sweet you want it</li>
                        <li><strong>Pumpkin Spice:</strong> Can be bought from most grocery stores, a teaspoon or so added for flavor and decoration</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Begin by heating up your milk of choice.</li>
                        <li>Pour your coffee into your cup of choice and mix in your pumpkin puree, maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla until well combined.</li>
                        <li>Froth your milk until it is foamy, which usually takes around thirty seconds.</li>
                        <li>Pour your frothed milk on top of your coffe-pumpkin mixture.</li>
                        <li>Add pumpkin spice on top for a little decoration and flavor.</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>This pumpkin spice latte is better than any pumpkin spice latte you will buy at a coffee shop. Also, having the ingredients at home means you are saving money. Instad of spending five dollars a day on a latte, spend about ten dollars or less a week on ingredients to make lattes throughout the week. It is delicious, efficient, and wonderfully festive.</p> 
                    
                <p>Whether you're just making it for youself, your friends, or your family, it is guaranteed to be a new favorite. You can make it as a hot beverage, or make it an iced latte by simply keeping the milk cold and adding ice! I prefer iced, but both ways are equally as incredible fro this cozy fall season.</p>
