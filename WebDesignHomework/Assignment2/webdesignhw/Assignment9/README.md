How to brew your own coffee
Materials Needed:
Coffee grinder
Coffee beans of choice
Clean water
Coffee filters
Coffee pot
Instructions:
Step 1: Grind the coffee
Obtain your coffee grinder and coffee beans. Grind up your coffee beans coarsely. Be sure to grind it finely; it is important for brewing later on.

Step 2: Bloom the grounds
After grinding up your coffee beans into a fine manner, place some of it in a coffee filter over your coffee pot. Pour a small amount of water over the coffee grounds and wait thirty seconds. These thirty seconds allow time for carbon dioxide to escape from the coffee beans, which helps water flow through the grounds more evenly..

Step 3: Pour the water, wait, and serve
Pour water over the grounds in a circular motion with the rest of your water. Let the water run through the grounds for about two and a half minutes. Serve immediately to prevent further brewing whch will make your coffee bitter. Serve and enjoy.

Recipe Notes: Coffee to water ratio
Ensure that you create a coffee to water ratio. I recommend 1 part coffee to 15 parts water. It is important to not do too much water or not enough water because it will negatively affect the flavor.
