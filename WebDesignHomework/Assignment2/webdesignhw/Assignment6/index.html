<h2><b>Color Choices</b></h2>

<p>I am choosing to use pastel colors for my website. This is because pastel colors are easy on the eyes and will not take any focus away from the words and other important elements. I feel like there is at least ojne pastel color that every person would enjoy. I am excited to make my website look sweet and happy with my choice of colors.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Pastel pink</li>
    <li>Pastel blue</li>
    <li>Pastel yellow</li>
    <li>Pastel green</li>
    <li>Pastel purple</li>
</ol>

<h2><b>Font choice</b></h2>

<p>The font I am choosing to use on my website is Alegreya. I am also choosing this font because it is pleasing to the eye, and I believe it matches my pastel colors extremely well. They both give off the same aesthetic, which is pretty and sweet. <cite>It was originally created for literature</cite>, so it looks nice on longer texts, which will be incorporated within my website.</p>

<h2><b>What is coffee</b></h2>

<p><i>Coffee </i> is best described as <dfn> A hot drink made from the roasted and ground seeds of a tropical shrub. </dfn>I will use this definition to guide through my menu, explaining how it is not always hot, but can be. It will be a wonderful introduction to my website.</p>
