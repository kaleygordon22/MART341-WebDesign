# Reflection #

The website that I am choosing to dive deeper on is my coffee website. I love coffee nd I have one just about everyday, so this will be perfect. The style I am going for is pastel colors and overall a very delicate look for the entirety of the website. 

Adding a new background color made the layout of my website beautiful. I changed it to a pastel pink, as I said I was going to do to make my website more aesthetically pleasing.

My final design was honestly exactly how I wanted it to turn out. I knew I wanted pastel colors and I wanted it to be organized. My layout was exactly that and I love it. 

I encounted all sorts of issues with this assignment. I would often mistake a parenthese for something else, and I would always put extra spaces and/or forget a space. I fixed this by using yours as an outline and taking out/putting in anything I messed up on. It all worked out well!
