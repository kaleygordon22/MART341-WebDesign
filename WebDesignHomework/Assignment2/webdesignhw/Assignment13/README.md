At Least 4 Pages –
My webpage consists of 4 pages: about, contact, gallery, and travel. 
Responsive Design –
The webpage doesn't line up perfectly on a phone screen, but everything shrinks down and fits. 
Media Queries –
The photos on each page shrink to fit on any type of screen.
Navigation Menu –
My navigation menu includes links to all pages of the website. 
Dropdown Menu -
So far, there aren't any sub-sections so a dropdown menu isn't necessary.
