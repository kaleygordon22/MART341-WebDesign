    <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to my excellent espresso guide! This is your gateway to the best coffee shops around the United States. I want to inspire all of you to not only travel for coffee, but travel to wherever you like for whatever you want. By using beautiful images, wonderful words, and anticipation for good coffee, I am living out my coffee dreams by sharing this website with the world. However, this site is not just about my coffee exploration. It is a website to show what coffee is, the best way to have it, and the best places to get it. However, coffee does not always need to be bought. You can make it, and I will teach you. Stick around with me and you are destined to have the coffee experience of a lifetime.</p>
