<h1>Website Ideas</h1>

<h3>Coffee Website</h3>

<p>My first website idea is a coffee shop. I am hoping the coffee shop website will draw in poeple from everywhere due to it's calm and aesthetically pleasing layout. It will be warm and inviting, making everybody want to check out the website and share it with others. </p>

<h3>Photography</h3>

<p>My second website would be about photography. It will be full of pictures taken around National Parks across the United States. I will label each photo with location as well as my specific techniques I used to capture the right images.</p>

<h3>Art</h3>

<p>I am hoping to create a website about all art that I have done. I paint landscapes, so I would love to show my work to anybody who wants to see. It would be a colorful website, which would represent my personality well.</p>
