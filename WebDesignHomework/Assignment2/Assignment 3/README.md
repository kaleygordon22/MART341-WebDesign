# Problems with assignment
## Solving the problems
When I first began the assignment, I was on the first step on GitHub and made a mistake. After typing "Assignment 3", I chicked "commit changes" before adding my README.md file to it. At first, I thought it would be an easy fix. However, I soon realized that I could not just take back that commited change. I tried everything I could, but nothing was working. After that, I contacted my professor and explained my situation. She was very quick with her responses and extremely helpful, which led to my success in the assignment.

Things I'm excited to learn throughout this course:
-gaining a better idea on files and how to create them
-how to code
-becoming more knowledgeable with my laptop and its elements
